### Instructions:
   - Download TWRP_Bootlogo_patcher-*.zip from [releases](https://github.com/enokseth/TWRP_Bootlogo_Changer-v2.2/releases)
   - unzip the file and replace : 
   - logo1.jpg by your desired custom logo with same name
   - Boot phone in TWRP
   - Flash the downloaded zip as any other
   - Reboot and enjoy

### Further info:
   - If your **exynos** device is not present in the list above, create an [issue](https://github.com/enokseth/TWRP_Bootlogo_Changer-v2.2) and tell me more about your device (Model number & possible model variations - F/FN/N/+/e/Ultra/Nfc and so on)
   - In case of reflashing modem/bootloader you will need to reflash this zip to nuke the warnings again (bootloader will overwrite the patch)
   - Any graphical glitch regarding the bootlogo, or any other exotic issue, will be fixed by reflashing bootloader of the specific software version you are running, however, in case you encounter any of those try to submit an [issue](https://github.com/enokseth/TWRP_Bootlogo_Changer-v2.2) in which i'll try to assist in fixing

### Patch steps (for nerds):
   - get the device bootloader version from cmdline
   - if the bootloader version matches device list - proceed to patch
   - unpack tools and prepare folders
   - find up_param and param blocks and set them as variables
   - check up_param for [booting_warning.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PMDv38E.jpeg)
       - if booting_warning.jpg exists and its size is different than logo1.jpg and letter1.jpg then it means it's not patched
       - backup up_param to internal storage
       - copy normal splash logo over [svb_orange.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bQ9wTeW.jpeg)
       - copy logo1.jpg and  over booting_warning.jpg, svb_orange.jpg,  (which makes the size of the file strict bytes)
       - repack up_param and flash back
   - check param for [booting_warning.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PMDv38E.jpeg)
       - if booting_warning.jpg exists and its size is different than logo1.jpg and letter1.jpg then it means it's not patched
       - backup param to internal storage
       - copy normal splash logo over [svb_orange.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bQ9wTeW.jpeg)
       - copy logo1.jpg and  over booting_warning.jpg, svb_orange.jpg, letter.jpg (which makes the size of the file strict bytes)
       - repack param and flash back
	

After these phone will show the logo, a warning containing the normal splash logo and a normal logo with 1px black warning overlay, which will make it look as normal and unrooted/locked bootloader. 

Yes, the warnings are not disabled, more like hidden, the phone will take same time as before to pass the splash screen but at least you won't have the hazard triangle which looks like it's soon going to explode (inb4 Note7, we will miss you).
